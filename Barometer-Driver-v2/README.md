# Barometer Driver
This is a work in progress. Currently trying to figure out if the Barometer driver is broken or if the physical component on board #2 is broken. You should be able to highlight the `Barometer-Driver` project and click run and access the serial stream using normal USB-FS means. From there, you should be to go back and debug if you want. I'm currently getting printouts that look like the following:

```log
Pressure: 0 Pa 
Temperature: 0 C 
```
